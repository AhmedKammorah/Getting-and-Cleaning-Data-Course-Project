Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- Download data files 
- unzip data files 
- read feature file 
- read x measurement train and test Files  
- trainX 
- testX
- merge two measurement data xTrain and xTest 
- extract mean/std measurement 
- Read y activity vaules and make col name activity 
- merge two activity data yTrain and yTest 
- compine y code with its activity label 
- compaine all data together X data and y with activety labels
